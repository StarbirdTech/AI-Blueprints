## Overview  

In this project, we provide notebooks to compare the execution time of dataset operations using traditional **Pandas** (CPU) versus **NVIDIA‚Äôs cuDF**, a GPU-accelerated drop-in replacement for Pandas. This example is presented in two different formats:

- **Data Analysis Notebooks**: These notebooks use preprocessed datasets of varying sizes from **datafabric** folder in AI Studio. The evaluation is split across two sets of notebooks: one set using Pandas (CPU) and the other set using cuDF (GPU)‚Äîwith performance metrics logged to **MLflow**.

## Setup

### Step 0: Minimum Hardware Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the minimum compute requirements for smooth dashboard rendering and cuDF performance:

- **RAM**: 16 GB  
- **VRAM**: 4 GB  
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU

### Step 1: Create an AI Studio Project

- Create a new project in [Z by HP AI Studio](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview).

### Step 2: Set Up a Workspace

- Choose **RAPIDS Base** or **RAPIDS Notebooks** as the base image.

### Step 3: Clone the Repository

```bash
https://github.com/HPInc/AI-Blueprints.git
```

- Ensure all files are available after workspace creation.

---  

### Step 4: Add the Dataset to Workspace
1.  Download the **USA_Stocks** dataset from AWS S3 using the Datasets tab in your AI Studio project:
  - **Dataset Name**: `USA_Stocks`
  - **Dataset Source**: `AWS S3`
  - **S3 URI**: `s3://dsp-demo-bucket/rapids-data`
  - **Bucket Region**: `us-west-2`
2. Make sure that the dataset is in the `datafabric` folder inside your workspace.

### Step 5: Use a Custom Kernel for Notebooks  
1. In Jupyter notebooks, select the **aistudio kernel** to ensure compatibility.


## Usage 

### Step 1: Run the Notebooks

You can choose to run the **two data analysis 'run-workflow' notebooks** located in their respective directories inside the  `notebooks` folder to compare the performance of **vanilla Pandas** (CPU) and **cuDF** (GPU).  

For the two data analysis *run-workflow* notebooks, results are available both **within the notebook** and through **MLflow tracking**.
