# Activating an Account


## Team Managers 

The first user to activate their account on a new license is designated as the Account Owner. Account Owners have unique responsibilities, like configuring the account and inviting other Team Managers. 

### To configure an account: 
  
1. Follow the link in the second email you receive from *aistudio@hp.com*. 

2. From the entitlements portal, click **New Account**. 

3. Enter your team's Account, User, and Agent information in the provided fields. 

    :::note 

    Use the *Admin Emails* field for the account users you wish to assign to the role of Team Manager. Team Managers can reassign user roles after account configuration from inside AI Studio.  

    ::: 

4. Click **Save** to finish configuring your team. 

Once you sign in to AI Studio you can finish setting up your team and invite users to collaborate.

:::note

If you're already signed in, sign out of your HP account before activating another one.
