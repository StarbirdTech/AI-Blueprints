# Changing User Roles

Team Managers have certain permissions in AI Studio that other contributing team members do not. They can add or remove team members, edit a team member’s role, and approve requests to join the team. 


### To change a user’s role: 

1. From the ***Account*** tile, navigate to Team Settings and find the user you want to edit. 

2. Click on the more options button on the right of the user’s row. 

3. Click **Edit role**. 

4. Select the new role you want to assign to the user, then click **Save** to change the user’s role.

    :::note
    
    Contributors promoted to Team Manager may be unable to remove users until their next log in.
