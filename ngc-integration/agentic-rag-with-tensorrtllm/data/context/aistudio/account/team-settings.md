# Team Settings

You can view and search for active members of your team under the ***My team*** tab. Pending invitations appear under the ***Pending*** tab until invitees accept or decline the invitation sent to their email address. 


### To add users to an existing team:

1. From the *Account* tile, navigate to ***Team Settings*** and click on **Invite team member**.

2. Enter their email address and choose their role from the dropdown.

3. Click on **Add more team members** and repeat step 2 for each user you want to add.

4. When youâ€™re finished adding members, click on **Invite** to add them to your team.



### To manage pending invitations:

1. From the *Account* tile, navigate to ***Team Settings*** and click on **Pending**.

2. Use the **Pending** tab to view which teammates still haven't responded to their invitation and the date they were invited to your team.

3. Team Managers can choose to resend an invitation or delete a pending invitee by clicking on the more options icon at the end of the row.

    - Click **Send Reminder** to resend the invitation.
    
    - Click **Delete Member** to cancel the invitation.

AI Studio sends each new member an invitation to join the team via email. Team managers can remove users from their team or edit individual user roles at any time by clicking on the more options icon beside the member you wish to manage. 

Invited user requests created by collaborators require administrative approval to allocate an account seat. Requested invitations will appear under the **Requests** tab.
