# Compute

AI Studio represents compute tabularly, providing you with an instant overview of the device(s) capabilities of each account user.  

### To view your team’s available compute: 

1. Navigate to the ***Account*** tile and select *Compute*. 

2. View details about the compute available to each device used by you and your team. 

The email address associated with each device appears to the left of a device’s name. The table displays the device's available cores and RAM to the right of the name. If applicable, this view also shows the GPU name and the GPU RAM attributed to each device.
