# Account Switching

AI Studio users with multiple accounts can switch between them from any screen with a few clicks. If you plan to work with multiple accounts, you can rename your display name to make it easier to find the team you're looking for.

### To switch accounts:

1. Click on your user icon in the upper-right corner of the screen.

2. Click on the account you want to switch to from the dropdown menu.

Users must be online to switch between accounts. Account switching requires an internet connection to sync and sync only occurs for a user’s last active account – other accounts do not sync in the background. If the app becomes unresponsive when one or more of the synchronizing users are offline, log out, then log back into AI Studio to restore your session.

An alert will inform users if AI Studio is unable to switch accounts. To restore account switching, stop all the project’s open workspaces and try again.
