# Navigating the Projects Page 
Whether youâ€™re a returning AI Studio user or this is your first time, you can find and manage your projects on a single pane of glass, directly from the Projects Page.

Dive into an existing project directly from the home page by clicking on the project tile. You can narrow homepage results with filters and customize how to sort them to find your projects in a snap. 

:::tip
Clicking the icon in the upper-right corner of a project tile triggers the project options dropdown box to appear.

### To create a new project: 

1. From the Projects home page, select **New Project**.  

2. Enter a name and description for your project, then choose a privacy status for the project. 

3. (Optional) Enter the URL for the Git Repository you wish to connect to the project and select a local folder to download your repository to, then click Continue. 
    :::tip
    Add tags to your project to make it easier for collaborators to find and organize them. 
    :::

4. (Optional) Use the assets catalog to select an asset to connect to from your list of configured assets or follow the steps for [Connecting Data To a Project](/docs/aistudio/using-aistudio/projects/connecting-data). 
    :::note
    Assets are objects, so they can be models or datasets. You can also click **Continue** without adding asset information to connect data to your project later from the Assets tab. 
    :::

5. Choose a workspace template, then click **Create Project** to create your new project. 


### To use your project: 

From the ***Projects*** home page, choose the project you wish to use. 

- Manage and run the workspaces from the *Overview* tab. 

- Monitor experiment runs in TensorBoard or MLflow from the *Monitor* tab. 

- Deploy your models locally from the *Deployments* tab. 

- Import models and datasets from AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or the GCP Object Store from the *Assets* tab.

### Filtering Projects

When using AI Studio, managing numerous projects can be challenging. To streamline this process, you can mark important projects as urgent using the ellipses menu and then filter by urgency. 

Additionally, you can filter projects by tags, priority, shared status, or other criteria. This approach helps in quickly locating the most relevant projects. Marking projects as urgent and utilizing filters can significantly enhance visibility and organization. For now, adding tags and filtering by them is an effective solution to manage crowded project lists efficiently.
