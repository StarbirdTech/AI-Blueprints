# Inviting Team Members

After you create and share a project, you’re ready to start collaborating. Team Managers can invite, accept, and resend pending invitations to assign team members to available seats. Contributors can invite users, but invitees need Team Manager approval before they’re assigned to an account seat.

### To invite more team members: 

1. Navigate to the ***Account*** tile. 

2. Choose the *Team Settings* tab, then select **Invite New Members**.

3. Enter their email address in the provided field, then click **Invite**. 

4. Click **Add more team members** to increase your team's size, then repeat steps 1 – 4 until your team is complete. 

5. After verification that the invited user’s account is activated, enter their role to delegate responsibility among collaborators.

    As a Team Manager, you can select the Account tile and navigate to the Team Settings tab to edit the roles of your team members at any time.

Team Managers can add or remove team members at any time, from *Team Settings*. Team managers can also send a reminder or delete members with a pending invitation status. Anyone can invite teammates to collaborate on a project, provided there are available seats.
