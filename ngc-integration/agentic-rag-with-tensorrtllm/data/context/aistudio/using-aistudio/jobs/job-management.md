# Job Management

The Jobs window has UI features designed to make scheduling, finding, and running jobs quick and easy. 

### Use the more options icon at the end of a job’s row to: 

#### Edit a Job 
Use Edit Job from the more options menu to update your configuration. 
 

#### Activate / Deactivate a Job 
Use (De)Activate Job from the more options menu to activate or deactivate your job. 

:::warning
If you deactivate your job, the scheduled job will not start and you will not be able to start the job until you manually reactivate the job.
:::


#### Delete a Job 
Use Delete Job to remove the Job from your list. 


#### Run a Job 
Use Run Now from the more options menu to immediately deploy your job. You can also deploy your model by clicking the start icon. 

:::note
Scheduling a job for a time in the past runs the job immediately after it’s created. You can schedule jobs for any past hour that is not before the current day.
:::

#### View a Previous Run 
Use See Last Run to view the python and system logs, output artifacts, job details, and job results associated with the job you ran most recently.
