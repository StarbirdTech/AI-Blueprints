# Managing Project Assets

Use the asset manager to view and manage a project's associated assets directly from the *Assets* tab. You can use the asset manager to connect a completely new asset. Or, you can edit, download, or remove any asset you or your collaborators connect to the project.  

### To connect new data to a project: 

1. From the projectâ€™s *Overview* page, navigate to the ***Assets*** tab. 

2. From the Project Assets window, click **Add Asset**, then click **New Asset**. 

3. Name and describe your asset, then specify your connection source.

    - **Local**: Enter the path to your local asset, then click **Create Asset**.

    - **AWS**: Enter the S3 URI associated with your asset, the bucket type, region, and description, then click **Create Asset**.

    - **Azure Blob Storage**: Enter the Blob URI associated with your asset, the resource type, and an asset description. Then, click **Create Asset**.
