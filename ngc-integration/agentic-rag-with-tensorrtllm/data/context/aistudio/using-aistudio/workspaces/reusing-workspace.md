# Reusing a Workspace 

Once you create a workspace, it appears as a tile on the **Project Overview** page. Projects can run multiple workspaces concurrently; each workspace notebook appears as a separate tab on the Projects page.

### To reuse a workspace: 

1. From your project’s home page, navigate to *My Workspaces* and select the workspace you want to reuse. 

2. Click the play icon to start your workspace.

    :::tip
    Select the more options icon and click **Edit Workspace** to view details about your workspace. 

    :::

3. Click the terminal icon to open your workspace notebook. The workspace notebook should run in a new tab beside *Project Setup*. 

    :::note
    Starting a workspace creates a container, while stopping one closes the associated container. Building a container may take a few minutes, depending on your machine’s capabilities.

Now that your workspace is running, you can start testing and collaborating on models directly from AI Studio.
