# Using Git in AI Studio

## Push and Pull
To push and pull in AI Studio, you will need to use Git within your workspace. 

Ensure that AI Studio is set as the **kernel** when creating a custom workspace. This helps avoid issues where the base image does not display the necessary packages. 

:::tip

When creating a custom workspace, set the kernel to AI Studio. Switch to the AI Studio kernel if you encounter any problems. This is crucial for maintaining functionality and ensuring that all required components are available in the workspace.

:::

## Designated Folders

All work should be saved within the designated folders. Take note of the folder stuctures:

- Save work within the provided folder structure to ensure it persists.
- Files outside the designated folders are erased upon restarting the workspace.
- Use local folders for private work and shared folders for collaborative projects.


## Jupyter Notebook 

Use Jupyter Notebook to push and pull changes after connecting to Git. The workspace will default to Jupyter Notebook.

## Kernel Settings
Set the kernel to AI Studio for custom workspaces.
