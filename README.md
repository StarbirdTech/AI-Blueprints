### üìà Data Analysis with cuDF  

In this project, we provide notebooks to compare the execution time of dataset operations using traditional **Pandas** (CPU) versus **NVIDIA‚Äôs cuDF**, a GPU-accelerated drop-in replacement for Pandas. This example is presented in two different formats:

- **Original Example Notebook**: This version, created by NVIDIA, runs the entire evaluation within a single notebook. It includes downloading the data and restarting the kernel to activate the cuDF extension.

- **Data Analysis Notebooks**: These notebooks use preprocessed datasets of varying sizes from **datafabric** folder in AI Studio. The evaluation is split across two notebooks‚Äîone using Pandas (CPU) and the other using cuDF (GPU)‚Äîwith performance metrics logged to **MLflow**.
