# Overview

This Project shows how to do machine learning classification using a Iris Flower dataset. The goal is to create a model that classifies the categorical variable (setosa, virginica or versicolor).

# Setup

### 0 ‚ñ™ Minimum Hardware Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the minimum compute requirements for smooth image classification performance:

- **RAM**: 4 GB  

### 1 ‚ñ™ Create an AI Studio Project

- Create a new project in [Z by HP AI Studio](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview).

### 2 ‚ñ™ Set Up a Workspace

- Choose **Data Science** as the base image.

### 3 ‚ñ™ Clone the Repository

1. Clone the GitHub repository:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HPInc/AI-Blueprints.git
   ```

2. Ensure all files are available after workspace creation.

# Usage

### 1 ‚ñ™ Run the Notebook

Execute the notebook inside the `notebooks` folder:

```bash
notebooks/iris_flowers_classification_with_svm.ipynb
```

This will:

- Load and prepare the data
- Summarize the Dataset, doing a overview.
- Visualize the data
- Build the Model and Measure Model.
- Integrate MLflow
