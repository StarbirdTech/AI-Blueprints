# Overview

This project is a simple **classification** experiment focused on predicting species of **Iris flowers**.

It runs on the **Data Science Workspace**, demonstrating basic supervised learning techniques for multi-class classification tasks.

# Setup

### 0 ‚ñ™ Minimum Hardware Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the minimum compute requirements for smooth image classification performance:

- **RAM**: 4 GB  

### 1 ‚ñ™ Create an AI Studio Project

- Create a new project in [Z by HP AI Studio](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview).

### 2 ‚ñ™ Set Up a Workspace

- Choose **Data Science** as the base image.

### 3 ‚ñ™ Clone the Repository

1. Clone the GitHub repository:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HPInc/AI-Blueprints.git
   ```

2. Ensure all files are available after workspace creation.

---

# Usage

### 1 ‚ñ™ Run the Notebook

Execute the run-workflow notebook first inside the `notebooks` folder.

```bash
notebooks/run-workflow.ipynb
```
This will:

- Load and prepare the data
- Summarize the Dataset, providing an overview.
- Visualize the data
- Build the Model and Measure its performance.

Execute the register-model notebook second inside the `notebooks` folder:

```bash
notebooks/register-model.ipynb
```
This will:
- Log the model to MLflow
- Run a trial inference with logged model

### 2‚ÄØ‚ñ™ Deploy the Iris flowers classification with SVM and LDA Service

- Go to **Deployments > New Service** in AI Studio.
- Name the service and select the registered model.
- Choose a model version. A **GPU** is **not necessary**.
- Choose the workspace.
- Start the deployment.
- Note: This is a local deployment running on your machine. As a result, if API processing takes more than a few minutes, it may return a timeout error. If you need to work with inputs that require longer processing times, we recommend using the provided notebook in the project files instead of accessing the API via Swagger or the web app UI.

### 3‚ÄØ‚ñ™‚ÄØSwagger / Raw API

Once deployed, access the **Swagger UI** via the Service URL.


Paste a payload like:

```
{
  "inputs": {
    "sepal-length": [
      5.1
    ],
    "sepal-width": [
      3.5
    ],
    "petal-length": [
      1.4
    ],
    "petal-width": [
      0.2
    ]
  },
  "params": {}
}
```
Expected response:

```
{
  "predictions": [
    "Iris-setosa"
  ]
}

```
