<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 40px;"> Data Science for HP AI Studio </h1>

The blueprint projects in this folder demonstrate how to create **Data Science projects** using [**HP AI Studio**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/ai-studio.html).

We provide **two blueprint projects**, each designed for quick and easy use to help you get started efficiently.

# üå∑ Classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

This project is a simple **classification** experiment focused on predicting the species of **Iris flowers**.

It runs on the **Data Science Workspace**, demonstrating basic supervised learning techniques for multi-class classification tasks.

# üò∑ Data Analysis with Vector Auto Regression (VAR)

This project explores a **regression** experiment using **mobility data** collected during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It highlights how city-level movement patterns changed during the crisis. The experiment runs on the **Data Science Workspace**.
