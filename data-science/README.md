The blueprint projects in this folder demonstrate how to create **Data Science projects** using [**HP AI Studio**](https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/ai-studio.html).

We provide **2 blueprint projects**, each designed for quick and easy use to help you get started efficiently.

# üò∑ Data Analysis with VAR

This project shows a visual data analysis of the effects of COVID-19 and how the population responded to the disease in two different cities: New York and London. It uses fundamental statistical operations for better analysis.

# üå∑ Classification with SVM

This Project shows a famous machine learning classification problem using Iris Flower Dataset. The goal of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features. It uses fundamental predictive **machine learning models** such as Logistic Regression for classification.
