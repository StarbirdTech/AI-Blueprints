# Setup

### 0 ‚ñ™ Minimum Hardware Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the minimum compute requirements for smooth image classification performance:

- **RAM**: 4 GB  

### 1 ‚ñ™ Create an AI Studio Project

- Create a new project in [Z by HP AI Studio](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview).

### 2 ‚ñ™ Set Up a Workspace

- Choose **Data Science** as the base image.

### 3 ‚ñ™ Download the Dataset
1. This experiment requires the **tutorial_data dataset** to run.
2. Download the dataset from `s3://dsp-demo-bucket/tutorial_data/` into an asset called **tutorial** and ensure that the AWS region is set to ```us-west-2```.

### 4 ‚ñ™ Clone the Repository

1. Clone the GitHub repository:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HPInc/AI-Blueprints.git
   ```

2. Ensure all files are available after workspace creation.

# Usage

### 1 ‚ñ™ Run the Notebook

Execute the notebook inside the `notebooks` folder:

```bash
notebooks/covid_movement_patterns_with_var.ipynb
```

This will:

- Load and prepare the data
- Analyze the data Univariately and Bivariately
- Analyze the correlations between the features
- Decompose Time-Series
- Perform Exponential Smoothing Prediction Methods
- Perform Vector Autoregression (VAR)
- Test Cointegration
- Analyze Stationarity of a Time-Series
- Train the VAR model
- Analyze Autocorrelation of Residuals
- Forecast
- Evaluate the model
- Integrate MLflow
