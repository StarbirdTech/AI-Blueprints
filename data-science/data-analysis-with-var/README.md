# Overview

This project explores a **regression** experiment using **mobility data** collected during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It highlights how city-level movement patterns changed during the crisis. The project runs on the **Data Science Workspace**.

# Setup

### 0 ▪ Minimum Hardware Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the minimum compute requirements for smooth analysis performance and running of a regression algorithm:

- **RAM**: 4 GB

### 1 ▪ Create an AI Studio Project

- Create a new project in [Z by HP AI Studio](https://zdocs.datascience.hp.com/docs/aistudio/overview).

### 2 ▪ Set Up a Workspace

- Choose **Data Science** as the base image.

### 3 ▪ Download the Dataset

1. This experiment requires the **tutorial_data dataset** to run.
2. Download the dataset by going to the **Datasets** tab of AI Studio, click on **Add Dataset** button and fill in the following:
   - **Asset/Dataset Name**: tutorial
   - **Dataset Source**: AWS S3
   - **S3 URI**: `s3://dsp-demo-bucket/tutorial_data/`
   - **Resource Type**: Public(No credentials required)
   - **Bucket Region**: `us-west-2`

### 4 ▪ Clone the Repository

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HPInc/AI-Blueprints.git
   ```

2. Ensure all files are available after workspace creation.

---

# Usage

### 1 ▪ Run the Notebook

Execute the run-workflow notebook first inside the `notebooks` folder which will save model artifacts as pkl files and training metrics as a JSON file to the artifacts folder :

```bash
notebooks/run-workflow.ipynb
```

This will:

- Load and prepare the data
- Perform univariate and bivariate data analysis
- Analyze the correlations between the features
- Decompose Time-Series
- Perform Exponential Smoothing Prediction Methods
- Perform Vector Autoregression (VAR)
- Test Cointegration
- Analyze Stationarity of a Time-Series
- Train the VAR model
- Analyze Autocorrelation of Residuals
- Forecast
- Evaluate the model
- Save model artifacts as pkl files and training metrics as a JSON file to the artifacts folder

Execute the register-model notebook second inside the `notebooks` folder:

```bash
notebooks/register-model.ipynb
```

This will:

- Load and prepare the data for viewing
- Load the saved models as well as the training metrics
- Integrate MLflow
- Run a trial inference with logged model

### 2 ▪ Deploy the COVID Movement Patterns with VAR Service

- Go to **Deployments > New Service** in AI Studio.
- Name the service and select the registered model.
- Choose a model version. A **GPU** is **not necessary**.
- Choose the workspace.
- Start the deployment.
- Note: This is a local deployment running on your machine. As a result, if API processing takes more than a few minutes, it may return a timeout error. If you need to work with inputs that require longer processing times, we recommend using the provided notebook in the project files instead of accessing the API via Swagger or the web app UI.

### 3 ▪ Swagger / raw API

Once deployed, access the **Swagger UI** via the Service URL.

Paste a payload like:

```
{
  "inputs": {
    "city": [
      "New York"
    ],
    "steps": [
      2
    ]
  },
  "params": {}
}
```

And as response:

```
{
  "predictions": [
    {
      "retail_forecast": -33.728463233848125,
      "pharmacy_forecast": -30.846298674683787,
      "parks_forecast": 10.141207881911434,
      "transit_station_forecast": -22.428499788561272,
      "workplaces_forecast": -22.99469300562751,
      "case_count_forecast": 2408.7536947190256,
      "hospitalized_count_forecast": 98.59975487297108,
      "death_count_forecast": 11.877680770250993
    },
    {
      "retail_forecast": -38.21554995618252,
      "pharmacy_forecast": -30.56449061598022,
      "parks_forecast": -4.27564275594397,
      "transit_station_forecast": -39.14454598096768,
      "workplaces_forecast": -56.921910023079036,
      "case_count_forecast": 4896.93595036146,
      "hospitalized_count_forecast": 116.0842596188819,
      "death_count_forecast": 10.01707228744587
    }
  ]
}
