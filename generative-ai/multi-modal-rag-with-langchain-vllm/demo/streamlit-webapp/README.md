# How to Successfully Use the Streamlit Web App

## 1. Install Required Versions

Ensure that the following are installed on your machine:

- **Python** version **â‰¥ 3.12** (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## 2. Install Required Python Packages

Install the necessary Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

## 3. Run the Streamlit App

To start the Streamlit app, cd to the directory containing `main-for-cloud.py` or `main.py` and execute the following command in your terminal:

`main.py` is the recommended version as it uses the database cache for faster performance. If you want to run the app without database caching, use `main-for-cloud.py`. The `main-for-cloud.py` does not use the database cache, which may result in slower performance since the data is not saved to be queried. We use `main-for-cloud.py` for public cloud deployments where you do not want to store any local private data.


```bash
streamlit run main-for-cloud.py
```

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## 4. Select the Correct API Endpoint When Using the App

When interacting with the app:
- **Choose the exact and correct API URL** to connect to your deployed model.
- **Important:** The MLflow endpoint **must** use **HTTPS** (not HTTP).
- **Note:** In **Z by HP AI Studio**, the **port number** for your MLflow API **changes with each deployment**, so always verify the correct URL and port before starting a session.
- **Example URL:** `https://localhost:<port>/invocations`

## 5. Enter the corresponding information to your Azure DevOps Wiki

Example ADO Wiki Page Link:
`https://myorganization.visualstudio.com/Important_Project/_wiki/wikis/Important_Project.wiki/1234/Knowledge-Share`

Based on the above link, the breakdown of the fields you need are:
- **ADO Organization**: `myorganization`
- **ADO Project**: `Important_Project`
- **ADO Wiki Name**: `Important_Project.wiki`
- **ADO Personal Access Token**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows
