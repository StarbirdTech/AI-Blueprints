Dynamic Response of a Human Neck Replica to Axial-Compression Impact Loading,Energy: Physical,2014,set(),"Purpose: A human neck replica was made to simulate dynamic response to axial loading,  H1. Dynamic loading of neck replica can simulate realistic axial-compression injury to the cervical spine. H2. Severity of measured neck force depends upon impact load and velocity. H3. Neck flexion-extension position affects measured neck force. H4. Simulated neck musculature affects neck stability.

Procedure: Flexible life-sized neck replica was constructed with plastic vertebrae and intervertebral discs, surrogate head, and 5 neck muscle groups were simulated with cables and static weights. Drop tower impactor instrumented with force transducer applied consistent axial loads. Force plate at base of the spine measured response at 5000 sample/sec. Motion analysis of spine segments performed with reflective markers, high-speed camera at 600 fps, and image analysis software. Sensor output amplified, and converted to force (Newtons) using data acquisition system. Neck tested in 5 positions, 2 impact loads, 2 velocities, with low and high tension neck muscles, with minimum of 3 trials per condition. Force, impulse, impulse time, and loading rate in various conditions compared with ANOVA with repeated measures, P<0.05.

Data/Conclusions: Neck model replicated dynamic response of the neck to axial loading. Higher impact magnitude and velocity resulted in higher measured force at the base of the spine. Impact force was much higher in head-down or spear-tackling position. Impact caused extension in middle cervical spine (C2-5) and flexion in upper (C0-2) and lower (C5-7).
 High tension muscles resulted in higher loading rate, shorter impulse time, lower impulse, higher force, and less intersegmental motion.",United States of America,MN,,['nan']
The Effect of Nutrient Solution Concentration on Hydroponic Spinach Plants,Physics and Astronomy,2014,set(),"Studies comparing the mineral nutrition of hydroponically and conventionally grown vegetables have been inconclusive, an advantage of hydroponically grown vegetables is that mineral nutrient concentrations supplied to the plants can be directly controlled. Based on this information an experiment was designed to investigate whether the mineral nutrient content of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) could be increased by increasing the concentration of hydroponic nutrient solutions. Spinach was grown hydroponically using a commercially available nutrient source at 1.0, 2.6, 4.2, and 5.8 times the recommended concentration. Temperature and pH were monitored throughout the growing period. Plants were harvested at maturity. Plant length and mass were measured prior to analysis. Elemental analyses of the nutrient solutions and spinach leaves were performed by ICP-OES and ICP-MS. Speciation of the nutrient solutions was modelled using Visual Minteq. Plant biomass increased with increasing nutrient solution concentration. Free ion activities also increased with increasing nutrient solution concentrations. However, increasing the nutrient solution concentrations did not result in an increase the mineral nutrient concentration in the spinach leaves. The highest spinach leaf concentrations of all nine mineral nutrients investigated occurred in the lowest concentration of nutrient solution. The results illustrate the complex nutrient uptake dynamics of spinach, and that increasing the nutrient content of spinach may not be achieved by simply increasing the nutrient concentration of the growth medium.",United States of America,UT,,['nan']
Do Air Root Pruning Pots Accelerate Success in a No-Till Garden?,Physics and Astronomy,2014,set(),"The purpose of my project was to determine which eco-friendly growing system would produce the best vegetable transplants for a no-till garden.   I chose recyclable air root pruning pots and biodegradable peat pots because these growing systems address consumer demand for product-stewardship or environmentally-conscious products.

The study evaluated the subsequent growth of three vegetable species Solanum lycopersicum, Capsicum annuum, and Solanum melongena in a no-till garden after being propagated in specialized containers which allow for air root pruning compared with biodegradable peat pot production which does not.

Results show that both growing systems produced healthy transplants.  Peat pots produced plants with greater height growth and greater shoot fresh weights and dry weights.  Air root pruning pots produced plants with greater root fresh weights and dry weights.  Once the plants were transplanted in the garden, height growth was about the same for S. lycopersicum and C. annuum.  Height growth was greater in S. melongena grown in air root pruning pots.

Air root pruning growing systems cost about 5 times more than peat pot growing systems, so the use of air root pruning technology for vegetable transplant production may not be cost effective based on these results.  If I were to do a continuation of this project, I would expand my project to include fruit production results.",United States of America,LA,,['nan']
Insect-repelling Plants & New Organic Pesticide,Environmental Engineering,2014,set(),"Organochlorine pesticides in agriculture are not only powerful but also pollute the soil and destroy the ecosystem. As a result, scientists are currently looking for organic pesticides that can repel pests without causing environment pollution and risk to human body. Some plants have a high potential of repelling pests and have evolved to defend themselves from pests. If different organic pesticides were combined, then it would be a better pesticide because of the synergistic effect between these components. Individual plant extracts from pyrethrum, tobacco, garlic, and red pepper were tested on how fast it killed the crickets. The median lethal dose (LD50) which indicated the potency of the organic pesticides for pyrethrum, tobacco, red pepper and garlic was 0.42, 4.93, 20, and 50 respectively. Pyrethrum had the highest potency followed by tobacco, red pepper, and garlic. The sum of the individual death rate of crickets in tobacco which was 3 and pyrethrum which was 36 was less than the death rate of 84 caused by the combination of tobacco and pyrethrum. This indicated a synergistic effect between tobacco and pyrethrum. Synergistic effect was also seen between red pepper and pyrethrum. Because of its low LD50 and high synergistic effect with other plant extracts, agriculture with pyrethrum pesticides would be eco-friendly and economical. Organic pesticide research is significant to prevent environmental pollution and decrease the effect of bioaccumulative chemicals on humans and other living things. This project will help scientists find better combinations of organic pesticides for practical use in agriculture.",United States of America,TX,,['nan']
How Do Different Factors Affect the Accuracy of Neural Networks in the Binary Decision Making of Cancer Detection?,Earth and Environmental Sciences,2014,set(),"The purpose of this experiment is to determine how different factors affect the accuracy of artificial neural network, specifically for cancer detection.  Every factor tested did lead to a change in the accuracy of the network. 

The factors tested were the rate of learning, use of momentum, and the overall structure of the network. This experiment was performed using a self-written computer program and a data set of the laser fluorescence of colon polyp scans. The test produced two measurements of accuracy but only one is really used for my conclusions. While there was some unpredictability in the data, there were consistent patterns that I based my conclusions upon.

I conclude and my data suggests that a specific learning rate in each type of structure where the accuracy was maximized, as I hypothesized. Unlike my prediction the value was fairly high (above .75). It also appears that this specific rate is inversely proportional to size of the network. While I hypothesized that the momentum that has highest accuracy will be proportional to the rate of learning. Having multiple hidden layers in the network decreased the accuracy, instead of increasing it like I predicted. 

The contributions of this project are an increased understanding of how to build a more accurate artificial neural network and the ability to better predict cancer based on the laser fluoresces of colon polyp scans.",United States of America,MN,,['nan']
Dye Sensitized Solar Cells: New Structures and Components for Greater Efficiency,Engineering Mechanics,2014,set(),"Although fossil fuels have the capacity to power the Earth for decades, solar energy is an essential, environmentally friendly form of renewable energy that can supplement fossil fuel energy. The Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) is a form of renewable energy that relies on excitation of dye electrons to produce electricity; it is structurally versatile, uses a variety of components, and can be integrated into everyday products. The purpose of this project is to analyze various structural and performance aspects of DSSCs. During the study, DSSCs were tested for photo-electric conversion efficiency and practicality in common items. In the experimentation, four different structures of DSSCs were created: Structure “A” was a rigid DSSC with conductive glass electrodes and platinum catalyst, Structure “B” was a rigid DSSC with conductive glass electrodes and carbon nanotube catalyst, Structure “C” was a flexible DSSC with plastic electrodes, and Structure “D” was a fiber DSSC with carbon nanotube yarns. Analysis of the four structures showed that Structure A had significantly greater efficiency with upper standards of 7%. Furthermore, it was concluded that while Structure C had potential applications in certain plastics, Structure D had the greatest real world applications due to potential integration into various textiles. This project proved that DSSCs are the future of solar technology due to relatively high photo-electric conversion efficiency and potential, everyday applications. DSSCs are a new technology with a bright future in the energy industry; given 10-20 years they can make a difference in the economy, environment, and everyday life.",United States of America,TX,,['Fourth Award of $500']
A Novel Method for Determination of Camera Pose Estimation Based on Angle Constraints,Embedded Systems,2014,set(),"The method proposed here solves for the pose of an object and is most applicable in robotics. The calculation of camera pose estimation has been solved in many ways. The general solution involves finding the relationship between the object’s 3D coordinates and the coordinates from a 2D image. This solution yields the pitch, roll, and yaw of the object with respect to the camera, as well the displacement in x, y, and z. With most robotics, roll and yaw are constant because a robot won’t tilt sideways or forwards, therefore pitch is the only unknown within the rotation matrix. The pitch may be calculated through a proportion from the camera’s field of view, therefore constraining the rotation matrix. With this constrained, the problem converts to an algebraic problem, and not a linear transformation problem, thus increasing the speed of the algorithm. The same algorithm used to calculate pitch is used to calculate the angle created from the center of the target to the camera. This sets up a right triangle, and simple trigonometry is used to calculate distance. The final results yields distance on the (X, Y) plane, as well as the pitch of the target.",United States of America,MO,,['nan']

"A Novel Mathematical Simulation to Study the Dynamics of CD4 Cells, CD8 Cells, and HIV Viral Load",Materials Science,2014,set(),"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the virus that causes the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), affects more than 1.7 million Americans. This infection results in progressive failure of the immune system and an increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. HIV targets the T lymphocytes, specifically the CD4 (helper) cells and the CD8 (suppressor) cells, resulting in loss of function and eventually in the death of these cells. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of HIV viral load on CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells incorporating a population based model known as SIR model. The three compartments comprising this model were S (susceptible), I (infected), and R (removed i.e., immune or killed). Differential equations were established to study the interactions of HIV viral load, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells. These were solved using MATLAB ODE 45 module with a time step of 0.001 days and the results graphed and tabulated. The effect of medications on the HIV viral load and the CD4 T cells were also recorded.  In the presence of CD4 T cells, the HIV viral load was 40,000 copies per mL at 180 days. However, in the presence of CD8 T cells or medications to treat HIV, the viral load remained suppressed and close to baseline at 180 days. Thus, by using a SIR model, the CD8 T cells and medications were found to play a crucial role in suppression of HIV viremia. This has important implications in devising strategies to combat this deadly disease.",United States of America,TX,,['nan']
A Novel Approach to Solar Desalination Using Nanopaticles,Plant Sciences,2014,set(),"The purpose of the project was to determine if adding carbon nanoparticles to a salt water solution exposed to sunlight would cause steam to emerge from the water without it boiling and produce steam more efficiently than salt water alone.  The null hypothesis was that there would be no significant difference between the amount of steam produced by the solutions with or without nanoparticles.  The alternate hypothesis was that a significant difference in the change of volume, or steam produced, would be observed between the solutions with and without nanoparticles.  The hypotheses were tested by first creating a dispersed nanofluid of the carbon nanoparticles of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9% volume fractions in salt water, and a solution of salt water alone as a control.  The solutions were then exposed to focused sunlight for a period of ten minutes and the change in temperature and volume were recorded.  Each solution of nanoparticles was able to produce steam when exposed to sunlight without boiling, but the control solution was not.  The average changes in volume for the 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9% solutions were 1.7, 2.0, 2.6, 4.1, and 4.7mL respectively, and the control had an average change of 0.1mL.  T tests and other forms of statistical analysis were done and these differences between the test groups and control groups were found to be significant.  The data therefore supported the alternate hypothesis and refuted the null hypothesis, meaning the alternate hypothesis was the most likely explanation for the phenomena observed during experimentation.",United States of America,FL,,['nan']
Enhanced Third-Generation Biofuel Production from Genetically Modified Algae,Systems Software,2014,set(),"Algae are one of the most promising sources of biofuels because of their environmental sustainability, and the direct use of algal lipids as fuels. Conventional methods of extracting these lipids, however, prevent algal biofuels from being a commercially viable option. This project introduces a novel technique that cuts costs of lipid extraction through genetically modifying the algae. As opposed to conventional hexane extractions that break the cell wall, thereby killing the algae, gene modifications of Acyl-ACP synthetase (Δaas) and truncated thioesterase (tesA) allow for automatic excretion of lipids. In addition to excretion, lipid production itself was also optimized. The knockout of Δaas yielded 44.90 mg/L and the Δaas ‘tesA culture yielded 33.15mg/L of lipids. As hypothesized, cell functions were not inhibited by the transformation; therefore, a single culture of algae is able to continually produce and excrete lipids as opposed to the re-culturing necessary in traditional methods.To maintain high algae cultures for large-scale production, an original raceway system, CACBA, was developed to efficiently culture algae through specifically engineered cultivation conditions. This brought the algae culture on par with the biofuel demand; each culture of algae holds millions of lipid-excreting cells. Emissions tests were conducted on biodiesel mixtures for a vision of a smooth transition from petroleum to biofuels. It was found that as the percentage of biofuel increased, the harmful emissions causing air pollution decreased. As of 2014, optimization rates were determined to be 35.39% biofuel and 64.61% petroleum. It was concluded that this project significantly improves the commercial viability of algal biofuels, potentially lowering costs to $2.87/gallon of fuel.",United States of America,TX,,"['Third Award of $1,000']"
The Use of MnSOD in Combined Modality Therapy to Sensitize Lung Cancer Cells to Ionizing Radiation and Chemotherapy,Mathematics,2014,set(),"Lung cancer is the deadliest cancer claiming 159,480 deaths in 2013 (American Cancer Society). Lung cancer may also become chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistant. Manganese Superoxide Dismutase (MnSOD), a naturally occurring enzyme, converts Superoxides into Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2). If MnSOD levels are supplemented in cancer cells which are naturally deficient in catalase, then the excess production of H2O2 will weaken the cancer cell, causing the cell to be more responsive to chemotherapy and radiation, while potentially protecting healthy lung tissue due to higher levels of catalase.
   
H1299 and HCC4006 resistant lung cancer metastases were used since metastasis and resistance are defining factors of patient prognosis. After supplementation with 24 µM MnSOD mimetic for one hour, the cells were exposed to Cisplatin and/or Ionizing Radiation. Next, the cells were seeded and colony formation was assessed. After determining clonogenic survival, Western Blotting was used to assay for PARP cleavage- indicating cell death through parthanatos.

MnSOD and Cisplatin treatment was 1.72x (H1299) and 2.92x (HCC4006) more effective than Cisplatin treatment alone, shown by a 71% decrease in surviving fraction (p<.001). In addition, MnSOD, Ionizing Radiation, and Cisplatin treatment was 2.39x (H1299) and 2.22x (HCC4006) more effective than treatment without MnSOD, shown by a 42% decrease in surviving fraction (p<.001). Also, both cell lines exhibited PARP cleavage indicating parthanatos- potentially reducing inflammation and side effects for patients undergoing cancer treatment. The results showed that MnSOD was able to sensitize lung cancer cells to chemotherapy and Ionizing Radiation, and potentially protect healthy cells from cancer treatment.",United States of America,TX,,"['Second Award of $2,000']"

Isolation and Identification of Thermophilic Compost Bacteria and Screening of Their Cellulolytic Activity,Engineering Mechanics,2014,set(),"Thermophilic bacteria are able to work at high temperatures that enable faster and more efficient reactions such as biomass conversion into glucose. The objective of this study is to isolate thermophilic bacteria from compost and to determine their cellulolytic activity. Soil compost were taken for culturing. A single strain of thermophilic bacteria was isolated from the culture and was screened for cellulolytic activity by culturing it on cellulose-Congo red agar media and by computing for the hydrolyzing capacity (HC). Visible clearing zones signifying positive cellulose hydrolysis were observed and used to evaluate the HC. HC was calculated to be ranging from 2.8 to 4.3. The bacterial isolate was identified up to genus level as a Bacillus sp. through a microscopic analysis performed by an expert from a national science institution. The isolated Bacillus sp.was grown in enzyme production media for crude cellulase extract preparation. Crude cellulase extract was subjected to carboxymethylcellulase activity assay. Results revealed that the cellulase showed little activity relative to glucose ( standard) with the largest exhibited activity at 0.0065 µmol of glucose liberated by 1 mL of crude cellulose every minute. The study demonstrated that certain thermophilic compost bacteria are able to hydrolyze cellulose, and have potential for being developed for larger-scale use in converting biomass into fermentable sugars for bioethanol production.",Philippines,,,['nan']

New Approach to Synthesis of Glucose-Phosphates and Their Use to Increase the Efficiency of ATP,Earth and Environmental Sciences,2014,set(),"The aim of presented work:
1.	Elaboration of new approach for glucose-6-phosphate preparation
2.	Phosphate-ions delivery into cell consisting of glucose
The main target of this work is to delivery a phosphate-group consisting of glucose into cell and reduce ATF consumption for glucose phosphorylation  and  promotion ATF synthesis from ADF.
In order to bring a phosphate group to sixth carbon atom the 1, 2 and 3 hydroxyl groups must be blocked. Therefore  a certain sequence of chemical transformation has been observed: glucoses interaction with sulfinyl chloride (blocking reagent) in the presence of pyridine, future reaction with chlorine anhydride of dialkyl phosphates and one-stage availability of glucose-6-phosphate. 
Because of the low yield of target product (20%) in suggested method the new way for phosphate groups introduction has been offered. In this case reaction is carried out without blocking agent as long as selected reagent (trichloranhydride of phosphon dichloracetic acid) is used at the same time as phosphorylating and prohibit agent. The pointed preparation method allowed to increase the yield of glucose-6-phosphate up to 50-60%. Addition of the synthesized glucose-phosphates to rats food in amount of 0,5-1%  leads to increasing their activity. In order to get the full approval of glucose-6-phosphate entry into cell it is necessary to use the isotopes technique.
We succeed in elaboration of new approach for glucose-6-phosphate preparation. In laboratory conditions the influence of synthesized preparation on rats activity has been determined and apparently may be concerned with increasing of ATF content in human.",Azerbaijan,,,['nan']
Analysis and Design of Powered Exoskeleton Technology Emulating Human Body Functions,Energy: Chemical,2014,set(),"Robotic exoskeletons are used to lift heavy weights at the sacrifice of limiting human functions, such as control, range of motion, grasping, and structural integrity.   One key to this project is to design and test a robotic exoskeleton with goals to improve on the human functions that were once lost for someone with a maimed or injured arm while keeping the system lightweight and energy efficient. 

If a system can integrate a hybrid combination of electrical, hydraulic or pneumatic technologies to emulate human body motion and capabilities, then the system can serve as an independent or integrated energy efficient exoskeleton to perform common tasks and improve human functionality.

I developed wooden and PVC wrist models that operated due to dual motors on the end effector allowing the system to flex and extend.  I applied a weight to the end effectors and then ran the motors at the lowest speed.  Both systems lifted a maximum of 407g.  I concluded that the motor does not run any slower when higher weights are applied, but won’t run if the weight is too high.  I tested the servos for control of speed.  I was able to control the speed, which will be useful in my final model.  The small servos meet the goal of lightweight low energy consumption devices, but are limited in the weight they can lift.    I developed a mathematical model for human function.
